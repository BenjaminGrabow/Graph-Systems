// Graph System 

// - has Nodes and Edges

// Search Algorithm: Breadth First Search algorithm
// Find the shortest path between 2 nodes
// Looks for the nearest nodes everytime
// Example:
// We need object which keeps track of :

// Node: which is a value 
// Edge = []
// searched - true or false 
// parent (keep track of parents)


// Graph Object:
//stores: 
// nodes = [] (all nodes);
// graph = {} (stores data structure about node - hash table)
